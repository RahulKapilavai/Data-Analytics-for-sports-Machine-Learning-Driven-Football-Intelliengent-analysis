## Welcome to the Football Stats Analysis project. This project leverages the powerful data manipulation capabilities of Pandas in Python to analyze football statistics. Our goal is to extract meaningful insights from various football statistics by loading, aggregating, and clustering the data.

## Project Workflow Overview

1. **Loading Excel Sheets into Pandas DataFrames**
    - Import the pandas library for data manipulation.
    - Specify the Excel file containing football statistics.
    - Define sheet names to load into separate DataFrames.
    - Utilize a dictionary to map each sheet to a DataFrame for easy access.

2. **Aggregating DataFrames by Team**
    - Iterate through each DataFrame to aggregate data by the 'Team' column.
    - Compute the mean of numeric statistics to summarize team performance.
    - Update the dictionary with aggregated DataFrames.

3. **Data Aggregation and Merging Process**
    - Initialize a merged DataFrame with data from the first sheet.
    - Iteratively merge DataFrames on the 'Team' column.
    - Use `how='outer'` in the merge function to ensure all teams are included.

4. **Preparing Data for Clustering**
    - Drop the categorical 'Team' column, as clustering algorithms require numerical data.
    - Impute missing values and standardize the data to have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one.

5. **Performing K-Means Clustering**
    - Apply the K-Means algorithm to partition the dataset into clusters based on similarities.
    - Assign cluster labels to each team and integrate these back into the original DataFrame.

6. **Analyzing Clusters for Strategic Insights**
    - Calculate mean statistics for each cluster to understand different performance characteristics.
    - Utilize PCA for dimensionality reduction and visualize the clusters.

## Key Findings and Insights

- Through K-Means clustering, teams were grouped based on their performance metrics, revealing distinct clusters that may correspond to different strategies or levels of success.
- Cluster analysis indicated significant differences among clusters in key areas such as scoring, defense, and overall team performance.
- The project highlighted the importance of touchdowns and points scored as differentiators among the clusters.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrated the power of using Pandas for handling and analyzing complex datasets, such as football statistics. By aggregating, merging, and clustering the data, we gained valuable insights into team performances, which can be further explored for strategic advantages.

## How to Run This Project
